# Sidify-Store
An ecommerce web application where people can seamlessly buy products online and then securely make payments using the Stripe payment gateway.

In this project, I used HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js for my FrontEnd. And then I used Sanity.io to manage my BackEnd. The payment system used is called Stripe. It is a global payment gateway system where people can securely make online transactions.

The target group of my project are men, women, and teenagers, people who have a heart for clothes shopping and fassion, and people who are into sportsware. 

The benefit of using this web application ecommerce store is that you can do shopping at the comfort of your own house, and at the convenience of your own time. You can avoid long traffic jams on the road and log queues at a physical store. The best part is that you don't have to go through the trouble of creating an account and havving to login before making a purchase, you simply add your desired item into the shopping cart, go to checkout, make your payment and wait as your product gets delivered on your doorstep. 

# Installation Instructions:

To run this project locally on your machine is very simple. Before running this application, please note that you must have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it on your machine, you can visit this link: https://nodejs.org/en and easily install it. 

I would highly recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for ease of access. This can still be done using your terminal, but then you will have to change to the directory of this project. With Visual Studio Code, you just open a new terminal and then you are automatically directed to the location of this project.

After you are in the directory or location, just simply type "npm run dev" and then it will tell you that the project is running at this address: http://localhost:3000. You can either press the Ctrl button and click that link simultaneously and then it will open the project for you in your web browser OR you can just copy the link and then paste it on your web browser. The application will open and work as expected.

# Should it give problems:

If after attempting the steps above, and the application still doesn't work, then on your terminal, in Visual Studio Code, make sure that you are in the directory of your project. Then you simply run "npm install". This will install all the dependencies I installed and used when building this web application, to your machine. These dependencies and packages are in the package.json file.

Enjoy using this web application! 



=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
